        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**: This is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called an object. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps protect the object's integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. This simplifies interactions and helps users understand the essential characteristics without being overwhelmed by details.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables methods to do different things based on the object they are acting upon, even if they share the same name. This can be achieved through method overriding (in subclasses) or method overloading (within the same class).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Classes and Objects**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining the attributes and methods that the objects will have. An object is an instance of a class, representing a specific implementation of that class's structure and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts work together to enable better organization, modularity, and maintainability in software development."
